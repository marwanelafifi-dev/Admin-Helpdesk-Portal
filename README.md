## Quick Start (Development)

```bash
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
cp .env.example .env.local   # fill in AUTH_SECRET, NEXTAUTH_URL, SMTP_*, etc.
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3003](http://localhost:3003).

## Request Data Reliability

- New requests receive server-issued sequential IDs per module and year.
- Concurrent submissions and retried network requests cannot overwrite or duplicate requests.
- Pending status, assignee, and request edits are preserved during navigation and background synchronization.
- Request pages re-render from the merged engine cache after server sync.
- Admin Database module counts come from the authoritative server request store and refresh after clear or restore operations.
- Server upserts preserve existing request attachments when a quota-stripped browser cache posts a lightweight update.

## Key Architecture

### Data Storage

All request data is stored in server-side JSON files (no PostgreSQL for requests in v1 — Prisma is wired for future migration):

```
/app/data/
├── requests.json        # All request records
├── comments.json        # Per-request comment threads
├── feedback.json        # Survey records + responses
├── announcements.json   # Sent announcements, drafts, and reusable templates
├── users.json           # User accounts
├── roles.json           # Role definitions + permissions
├── company-data.json    # Lookup tables (suppliers, managers, etc.)
├── platform-settings.json  # Branding, feedback survey config
├── backup-schedule.json    # Automated backup schedule
└── email-config.json    # SMTP configuration
```

### Scheduled Backups

- Configurable from Admin → Database → "Scheduled Backups" card
- Frequencies: hourly / daily / weekly / monthly
- Files saved to `~/admin-helpdesk-Backup` on the host
- Retention policy: auto-prune oldest files
- Background check every 5 minutes via `src/instrumentation.ts`

### Permission System

Four built-in roles:

| Role | Access |
|------|--------|
| Full Access | Everything (super-admin) |
| Administration Team | All modules + dashboard + team tasks |
| People Team | Selected modules only |
| Requester | Own requests only, selected modules |

Permissions are fully customizable per-role from Admin → Roles.

### Email Notifications

Automatic emails on:
- New request submitted (To: admin team + requester + helpdesk; Cc: direct manager + form CC recipients)
- Status update
- New comment added
- Task assigned
- Purchase approval request (one-click Approve / Reject links in email)
- Feedback survey (configurable — can be disabled from Admin → Settings)

### Admin Announcements

The Admin Announcements page sends branded company-wide emails using the same SMTP configuration as notification emails.

- Route: `/admin/announcements`
- Read-only route for all users: `/announcements`
- Permission: `page:admin-announcements` (included for Full Access and Administration Team by default)
- Recipients: all active company users, manually entered To recipients, selected directory users, and CC recipients
- Default To recipient: Egypt Team `<eg.team@si-ware.com>` can be included or removed from the compose panel
- Attachments: uploaded from the portal and sent with the email
- Signature: Admin Helpdesk signature is editable per announcement or template
- Templates: reusable subject/body/signature templates for common notices, with optional scheduled auto-send date/time
- Drafts: save incomplete announcements and reopen them later
- Sent history: stored in `data/announcements.json` with recipient count, CC count, attachments, and sender details
- Employee view: `/announcements` shows sent announcements, unread count, read state, and attachments
- Bell notifications: unread sent announcements appear in the notification bell for each user
- Backups: `announcements.json` is included in Admin Database backup/restore and scheduled backups

## Adding a New Page

1. Create `src/app/(dashboard)/<page>/page.tsx`
2. Add entry to `src/lib/pageRegistry.ts` (auto-wires middleware + Roles checkbox)
3. Add permission `page:<id>` to relevant roles in `data/roles.json`
4. Add nav item to `src/components/layout/Sidebar.tsx`

## Adding a New Module

Follow the same 4 steps above, plus:
5. Add module id to `RequestModule` union in `engineService.ts`
6. Add `MODULE_PREFIX` entry in `engineService.ts`
7. Add to All Requests and My Requests filter pills
8. Add to Database page `REQUEST_MODULES` array

## Importing Requests

Administrators can import request JSON from **Admin > Database > Import Requests**:

1. Select the destination module/page.
2. Click **Import Request JSON**.
3. Upload a JSON file containing one request object or multiple request objects.

Accepted JSON shapes include:

- A single request object.
- An array of request objects.
- `{ "request": { ... } }`
- `{ "requests": [ ... ] }`
- `{ "data": [ ... ] }`
- A backup wrapper containing `data.arp_requests`.

Every request must contain the selected module id and the required request fields. Imports are atomic and never overwrite existing data. If any request ID already exists in live requests, appears more than once in the file, or remains in the recycle bin, the entire import is rejected and no records are saved.

## Request Attachments

All request forms persist uploaded files in `payload.attachments` as base64 data URLs so they can be viewed by other users and on other devices. This applies to Shipping, Maintenance, Purchase, Event, Travel, HR onboarding/offboarding, and General requests.

The request detail page loads the complete request from the server before rendering the **Attachments** tab. Browser localStorage is only a fallback because its quota-protection path may remove large attachment data from the local cache. Existing attachments remain stored on the server and reappear when the request detail page refreshes.

Server request upserts also preserve existing server attachments when a later browser update contains an empty or missing `payload.attachments` array. This prevents status, assignment, comment activity, or CC updates from accidentally overwriting the authoritative file list after browser quota protection strips local base64 data.
